sipplot
=======

command line, real-time SIP plotter. Way too often I needed to log into a remote machine and debug some SIP traffic, without X, and without  wanting to save the .pcap and to download it on my computer for analysis with wireshark.

So the idea was born. You will need libcurses, libosip2, and libpcap to compile.
